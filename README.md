This is a simple demonstration of the ASE-NI instructions in use in assembly, distributed under the GNU GPL V3 License.
It is mostly a proof of concept piece, and is heavily commented for easy readability. The script "speed.sh" can be run as a paramter for "time" to get a simple benchmark
for the speed of the code.
